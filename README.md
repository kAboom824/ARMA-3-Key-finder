# ARMA-3-Key-finder
This is a pretty simple set of code written in python to assist the section-7 server team for working with keys. I will probably expand it in the future to have some more features as required. This branch is here if the code will be run on a machine that has python installed on it already.

If you do not have python installed please see the [executeable branch](https://github.com/kAboom824/ARMA-3-Key-finder/tree/Executable).
