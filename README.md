# ARMA-3-Key-finder [Executable version]
This is a pretty simple set of code written in python to assist the section-7 server team for working with keys. I will probably expand it in the future to have some more features as required.

This branch is the EXECUTABLE branch of the code and has a few slight modifications to it. To use the program, download the .exe file and run it.
